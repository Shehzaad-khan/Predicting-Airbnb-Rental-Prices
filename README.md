## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Open and run the main notebook**
   - Navigate to `notebooks/` and open `Airbnb_Price_Prediction.ipynb`
   - Follow the workflow:  
     - Data Collection: Import Airbnb listing/host/review datasets  
     - Preprocessing: Clean and engineer relevant features  
     - Modeling: Train and evaluate ML models for price prediction  
     - Analysis: Visualize model performance and price trends
